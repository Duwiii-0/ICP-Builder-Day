            The <strong>Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)</strong> is a revolutionary blockchain 
            technology developed by <strong>DFINITY</strong> to create a fully decentralized 
            internet. It allows developers to build smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) 
            that run at web speed, offering infinite scalability.

        <p>
            ICP introduces a new model of decentralized computing where smart contracts, 
            known as **Canisters**, can host web services, interact with users, and process 
            data efficiently. It supports native Web3 applications, decentralized finance (DeFi), 
            and enterprise-level solutions.
